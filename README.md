# First_challenge
This project was part of my Bootcamp studies. 
Using a source code (.html and .css) I had to amend the code that way that it would be accessible.
To reach this goal I made sure that:
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
